# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by problem pattern. The problems are sourced from [this website](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/), which organizes LeetCode problems by common patterns.

## Problem Patterns

The following problem patterns should be covered eventually in this repository:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast and Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
- In-place Reversal of Linked List
- Tree Breadth First Search
- Tree Depth First Search
- Two Heaps
- Subsets
- Modified Binary Search
- Top 'K' Elements
- K-way Merge
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Topological Sort
- DFS (Depth First Search)
- BFS (Breadth First Search)

## Running the Solutions

All of the solutions are written in Python and can be run in a Python environment. Each solution file contains the LeetCode problem number and name, as well as the solution function. The solution function takes in the appropriate input parameters specified by the problem and returns the solution output.

Each solution file also contains a main function that demonstrates the solution with example inputs. To run the main function for a particular solution, simply run the corresponding file in a Python environment.

## Solution Performance

All solutions have been optimized for speed and memory usage. I have included the LeetCode submission results for each solution in the comments, which show the solution's runtime and memory usage as compared to other submissions.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you have a solution to a LeetCode problem that you believe performs better than the existing solution in this repository, please feel free to open a pull request with your solution.
